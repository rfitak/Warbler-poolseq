# Enrichment analysis
Here we used the list of 93 genes ([outlier-genes.list](./data/outlier-genes.list)) to determine whether they were enriched for any specific gene ontology (GO) terms. Luckily, the entire great reed warbler proteome is available in [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org) as proteome [UP000549775](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000549775).
